### Configurations files 
  - configuration_file.txt: This file contains the configurations for running the aimsun simulation.
  - topology.txt: This file contains the topological structure of the simulated network.

### Main scritps:
  - aimsun_api_sim.py: This script is used to run the aimsun simulations
  - extract_sim_detector_data.py: This script is used to extract the detector data post simulation.
  - generate_true_states.py: This function is used to generate true states from the trajectory files post simulation.

### Classes and supporting functions:
  - AIMSUNFUNCTIONS_V4.py: This file contains all the functions needed to interact with AIMSUN API.
  - Virtual_Sensors.py: This class contains the code for extracting true states from the trajectory data.
